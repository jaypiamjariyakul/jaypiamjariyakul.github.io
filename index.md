# Hi, I'm Jay.

### I am an engineer, composer, singer, web developer, and poet.

I am a Verification Engineer currently working on the Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) at [Arm](https://arm.com/).  \
All views are my own & do not reflect my employer's.

Outside of my engineering career, I also sing as a volunteer lay clerk at Magdalene College Chapel Choir in Cambridge, in addition to my role as Publicity Officer of [Elysium Music](https://www.elysium-music.co.uk/), a music charity aimed at providing musical opportunities between children and young professional musicians.

As a composer, I write music for choirs, orchestras, and multimedia - my pieces have been performed by ensembles across the UK including Magdalene College Chapel Choir, Caelestis, Bristol University Music Society, and Queens' Chamber Choir.

I also dabble in web development (e.g. this website and Elysium's), graphic design, writing poetry, collecting books & dust, and finding new things <a href="{{ site.url }}/todo" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: #000000">to do</a> instead of these.

[Get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contacts) for any queries on commissions or performing pieces from my [catalog]({{ site.url }}/portfolio).  \
Or just to say hi!
