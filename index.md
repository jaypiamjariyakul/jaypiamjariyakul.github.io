# Hi, I'm Jay.

### I am an engineer, composer, singer, web developer, and poet.

I am a Verification Engineer currently working on the Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) at [Arm](https://arm.com/).

> _All views are my own & do not reflect my employer's._

Outside of my engineering career, I also sing as a volunteer lay clerk at Magdalene College Chapel Choir in Cambridge, in addition to my role as Publicity Officer of [Elysium Music](https://www.elysium-music.co.uk/) - a music charity aimed at providing musical opportunities between children and young professional musicians.

As a composer, I write music for choirs, orchestras, and multimedia. My pieces have been performed by ensembles across the UK including Magdalene College Chapel Choir, Caelestis, Bristol University Music Society, and Queens' Chamber Choir.

My music has been shortlisted for the JAM on the Marsh's Call for Music 2025, and my piece [\"Prevent us, O Lord\"]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/choral/prevent-us-o-lord) won runner-up for the 2024 Hadfield Composition Competition.

I also dabble in web development (e.g. this website and Elysium's), graphic design, writing poetry, collecting books & dust, and finding new things <a href="{{ site.url }}/todo" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: #000000">to do</a> instead of these.

[Get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contacts) for any queries on commissions or performing pieces from my [catalog]({{ site.url }}/portfolio).  \
Or just to say hi!
