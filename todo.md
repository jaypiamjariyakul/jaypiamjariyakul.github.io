You've found my "secret" to-do list!  \
This is where I dump all the possible to-dos for this website.

If you have any suggestions on how to implement these, please feel free to do a pull-request on the site's repo.

- [ ] Make CV & portfolio sections collapsible
- [ ] Make site more mobile-friendly?
- [ ] Add more portfolio items
- [ ] Add a proper bio...
- [ ] How to specify section breaks in MD? Can it convert to breaks in HTML? (ideally without parser, or minimally)
- [ ] Hide the HUGE margin between name & body of CV page in `Print` view
