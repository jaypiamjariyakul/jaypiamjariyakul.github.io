'Pon Christmas Night, a wintry world forsaken   \
Had beckon'd forth the Star - a Child is born!  \
That ushered forth a Peace, so calm and quaint, \
And bathed this world in a heav'nly Dawn.       \
_Lullabye, sweet Babe! Lullabye, so long ago -_ \
_'Pon this Christmas Night._

Unto the shepherds, Seraphic hosts appear'd     \
To lead a road all holy, gentle, kind!          \
Towards the Lamb, a Prince of Peace so dear,    \
Kept by the Mystic Rose all Divine!             \
_Lullabye, sweet Babe! Lullabye, so long ago -_ \
_'Pon this Christmas Night._

Before the cradle-throne, where Christ asleeping,   \
Faithful from yonder came (in poor and fright)      \
And adorned God! In reverence and weeps,            \
Exalted they, "Glory be to Light!"                  \
_Lullabye, sweet Babe! Lullabye, so long ago -_     \
_'Pon this Christmas Night._

'Pon Christmas Night, came down a Love remained     \
Ev'n as I shall, in time or death, depart...        \
So sing in Alleluyahs! To His joyous reign,         \
I give to Him: my humble Heart!                     \
_Lullabye, sweet Babe! Lullabye, so long ago -_     \
_'Pon this Christmas Night._
