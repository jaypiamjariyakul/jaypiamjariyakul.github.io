## Proficiencies

### Problem Solving & Creativity
- Used an OOP-based approach (with SystemVerilog class handles) to verify a novel message-collating sub-component in the next generation of GIC. Despite initial pushbacks and risk of confusion, this method uses the full extent of SystemVerilog’s OOP capabilities not previously seen in GIC’s past projects, and allowed for cleaner and more accurate verification of the block, especially when architectural compliance must be upheld.
- Developed a methodology for collecting coverage data from functional verification & image quality metrics given top-level specifications with Python & SV as part of my Arm internship and graduate schemes, and designed database methods for storing & querying the collected information.
- Using a new in-house machine learning framework, prototyped a novel method of reducing number of regressions required to achieve the same percentage of functional coverage.
- Designing & fabricating a Rubik’s Cube puzzle-solving robot from minimal requirements, with concerns to resource efficiency, performance, design choices, longetivity, and output verification.
- Programmed a PNM to PGM conversion (and vice versa) in C & an FPGA byte generator/detector in VHDL from minimal specifications, and programmed a disease/population analysis program in Python.

### Proactivity & Preparedness

- Researched multiple approaches to building verification of a block, as part of being the verification lead on a new message-collating sub-component within GIC. Eventually settled on a OOP-based approach using class handles to ensure ordering with consideration of information visibility between two separate I/Os in a system, with reasonable justification and planned mitigations to reduce confusion in specifications.
- Took executive decision, with justification for time, to reduce test cases required to verify a bugfix of a cross-system GIC implementation, as a result of encountering overly-random testing scenarios. Sufficient signoff undertaken & product was released on-time.
- Applied Git version control to our FPGA Digital Design & Embedded SoC Design Group Projects, and updated the repository daily. Backups are readily available & restored during occasional incidents, resulting in minimal work lost.

### Communication & Collaboration

- Developed the testbench and verification specifications for a novel message-collating sub-component within GIC. Asked for feedback on multiple iterations to ensure concise statements whilst retaining sufficient information, and guaranteed that all diagrams are visible despite color-blindness.
- Presented my Arm internship and rotations’ project proposals to members within Functional Verification and System IP teams. Organised project scope, approaches, and results into concise presentation topics.
- Developed communication skills & techniques essential to explaining difficult engineering concepts for children & students in the OutReach programme, including learning & understanding each individual’s needs.

### Teamwork & Leadership

- Verification lead on a message-collating sub-component that outputs messages from PCIe endpoints to the GIC as part of the next generation of GIC. Developed the block’s testbench from scratch, and coordinated functional verification on the block alongside the block’s designer and formal verification engineer. Current knowledge source of the block’s behaviors.
- Ownership of top-level end-to-end testing of the safety-compliant GIC - coordinated implementation of testing suites as part of GIC’s safety-compliant release signoff.
- Spearheaded Arm’s initiative of IET Partnership, alongside my mentor, and propelled a drive for engineering chartership within the community.
