## Work Experience

### Arm Ltd

*Cambridge, United Kingdom*

#### Verification Engineer

*October 2022 - Present*

- Verification lead on a message-collating sub-component that outputs messages from PCIe endpoints to the Generic
Interrupt Controller (GIC) as part of the next generation of GIC. Responsibilities include developing the testbench
from scratch, and coordinating functional verification on the block.
- Developed a model of an internal functional safety-compliant error-collecting unit/block for our formal verification
methodology, as part of our ongoing functional safety drive for automotives, in addition to writing directed and block/top-
level test sequences to test its register models and error/response-reporting capabilities.
- Utilized UVM and SystemVerilog’s functional and class-based coverage to analyze our component’s multi-chip con-
figuration and a ACE/AXIT translation interconnect, and made decisions on coverage waivers.

#### Graduate Verification Engineer

*August 2021 - October 2022*

- Collaborated on-site & remotely with engineers on significant projects within rotational teams, including implementa-
tion of a novel method to verify results of various protocol checkers, data transfers, and mass regressions - utilised
in the latest releases of functional safety-compliant interrupt controllers.
- Implemented a framework using machine learning models to reduce number of seeds required to achieve the same
regression coverage, and automated the pipeline for various testplans.

#### Image Signal Processing (ISP) Hardware Verification Intern

*June 2020 - September 2020*

- Collaborated with an external division within Arm to obtain metric processing scripts on Python, and developed a
database system to store parsed information, with scalability & user experience considered.
